# AI Log

## Initial request
I am currently looking at this repository:
https://github.com/vincesesto/persons-finder-devops2.git

I would like to create a Dockerfile for this repository so I can create an image to start working with my laptop and then transfer to a kubernetes environment.

Please use best practices when creating this Dockerfile, to make sure it is secure and is small and the code works quickly
```
# Run the Dockerfile with
docker build -t persons-finder:local .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 persons-finder:local
